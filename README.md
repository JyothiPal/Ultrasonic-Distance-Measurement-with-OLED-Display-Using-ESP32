# Ultrasonic-Distance-Measurement-with-OLED-Display-Using-ESP32
This project uses an ESP32 and an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to measure distance in real time and display the output on a 128x32 OLED screen (SSD1306). It provides a visual and serial interface for distance readings, ideal for obstacle detection, robotics, or proximity-based applications.
